## 1. Project Description

This repository contains the code and analysis for my dissertation, which investigates the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria. The project utilizes data science techniques to analyze both genetic sequence data and environmental metadata from various sources to identify key pathways and temporal trends of AMR dissemination.

## 2. Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for the purposes of reproducing the analysis and results.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Conda package manager (or pip)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)
    cd dissertation-amr-analysis](https://github.com/patrickayres/AntimicrobialResistanceAnalysis.git)]
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment and install dependencies:**
    This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage Python packages. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
